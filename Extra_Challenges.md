### 1. Implementing a 5-Day Forecast

**Concepts**:
- **API Interaction**: Understand how to use query parameters in your API requests to fetch a 5-day weather forecast instead of current weather. This usually involves reading the API documentation to find the correct endpoint and parameters.
- **Data Structures and Parsing**: Learn to handle more complex JSON responses, as 5-day forecasts will include data for multiple days. You’ll need to parse this and perhaps store it in structs or other suitable data structures.

### 2. Allowing Users to Specify Units (Metric or Imperial)

**Concepts**:
- **Command-Line Argument Parsing**: Extend your command-line argument parsing to include an option for users to specify their preferred unit system. This might involve using a crate like `clap` for more sophisticated argument parsing.
- **Conditional Logic**: Implement logic in your program to modify the API request based on the user’s choice, as most weather APIs allow you to specify units as a query parameter.

### 3. Caching Responses

**Concepts**:
- **File I/O and Serialization**: Learn to write data to and read data from files. This involves understanding Rust’s file I/O capabilities and possibly using JSON or another format for serialization.
- **Data Management**: Develop a caching strategy, like storing API responses with timestamps and checking if there's a recent response for the same query before making a new API request.
- **Error Handling**: Improve error handling to manage potential issues like file access errors or corrupted cache data.

### 4. Creating a User-Friendly Interface in the Terminal

**Concepts**:
- **Text Formatting and Coloring**: Use libraries like `colored` or `termion` for formatting and coloring text to make the output more readable and visually appealing.
- **Interactive Command-Line Interfaces**: If you want to make the interface interactive (like menus or prompts), you might explore crates like `dialoguer` or `crossterm`.
- **User Experience Design**: Think about the user’s experience, how to present information clearly, and how to guide the user through using your application.

Each of these challenges introduces you to new aspects of programming in Rust, from deeper API interaction to advanced command-line handling and caching strategies. They are designed to incrementally increase the complexity and functionality of your application, giving you hands-on experience with a wide range of programming concepts.
