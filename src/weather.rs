/// `weather.rs` contains the definitions and implementations related to weather data structures.
/// It's used to represent and format the current weather conditions fetched from an external API.
///
/// ## Structs
///
/// - `Current`: Represents the current weather conditions including observation time, temperature, 
///   weather code, and descriptions.
/// - `Weather`: A higher-level struct that encapsulates the `Current` weather data.
///
/// ## Implementations
///
/// - `fmt::Display for Current`: Provides a custom human-readable representation of the current weather conditions.
/// - `fmt::Display for Weather`: Provides a custom human-readable representation of the weather data.
///
/// ## Dependencies
///
/// This module relies on the `serde` crate for deserializing JSON data and the `fmt` module from the standard library for custom formatting.
