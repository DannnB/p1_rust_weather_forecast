This is a project brief generated by GPT-4 for me to learn Rust through a project process. 

### Project: Terminal-Based Weather Forecast Application

**Overview**: Create a simple terminal-based application in Rust that fetches and displays weather forecasts for a given location. This project will introduce you to Rust's fundamentals, working with APIs, and handling JSON data.

**Key Concepts to Learn**:
1. **HTTP Requests**: Learn how to make HTTP requests to a weather API.
2. **JSON Parsing**: Handle and parse JSON responses to extract useful information.
3. **Error Handling**: Understand how to manage potential errors, like network issues or invalid input.
4. **Command-Line Arguments**: Learn to take input like location or date from command-line arguments.
5. **Displaying Data in Terminal**: Format and present the data in a user-friendly manner in the terminal.

**Steps**:
1. **Setup Project**: Create a new Rust project using Cargo, Rust's package manager and build system.

2. **Choose a Weather API**: Find a free weather API (like OpenWeatherMap or WeatherAPI) and understand how to use it. You'll typically need to sign up and get an API key.

3. **HTTP Request Library**: Use a crate like `reqwest` for making HTTP requests. Learn how to incorporate external crates in your Rust project.

4. **Parse JSON Responses**: Use a crate like `serde` for JSON serialization and deserialization. Learn to map JSON data to Rust structs.

5. **Implement Main Functionality**:
    - Allow users to input a location.
    - Make an API request to get the weather data for that location.
    - Parse the JSON response and extract the forecast information.
    - Handle any errors that might occur during these processes.

6. **Display Output**: Format and display the weather forecast in the terminal. Show details like temperature, weather conditions, humidity, etc.

7. **Extra Challenges**:
    - Implement additional features like a 5-day forecast.
    - Allow users to specify units (metric or imperial).
    - Cache responses to avoid unnecessary requests for the same location and date.
    - Create a user-friendly interface in the terminal.

**Learning Outcomes**:
- Basic understanding of Rust syntax and structures.
- Experience with external crates and API interaction.
- Skills in JSON handling and command-line argument processing.
- Practical understanding of error handling in Rust.

This project will give you a hands-on experience with Rust, from setting up a project to implementing real-world functionalities. It's both challenging and practical, offering a great way to delve into the language.
