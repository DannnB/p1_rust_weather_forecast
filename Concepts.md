To successfully complete the terminal-based weather forecast application in Rust, you'll need to understand several key concepts and be familiar with specific libraries. Here are the main concepts and corresponding documentation links:

1. **Basic Rust Syntax and Concepts**:
   - Understanding of basic Rust syntax, including variables, functions, control flow, and error handling.
   - Rust Book: [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)

2. **Handling Command-Line Arguments**:
   - Parsing command-line arguments to take user inputs like location.
   - Rust By Example: [Command Line Arguments](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/std_misc/arg.html)

3. **HTTP Requests with Reqwest**:
   - Making HTTP requests to an external API.
   - Reqwest Crate Documentation: [Reqwest](https://docs.rs/reqwest)

4. **JSON Handling with Serde**:
   - Serializing and deserializing JSON data, crucial for interacting with most APIs.
   - Serde Crate Documentation: [Serde](https://serde.rs/)
   - Serde JSON Crate Documentation: [Serde JSON](https://docs.rs/serde_json)

5. **Error Handling in Rust**:
   - Managing potential errors, such as network issues, parsing errors, or invalid input.
   - Rust Book: [Error Handling](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch09-00-error-handling.html)

6. **Working with Environment Variables** (Optional):
   - Using environment variables for API keys.
   - Rust Standard Library: [std::env](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/env/)

7. **Formatting and Displaying Data**:
   - Presenting data in a user-friendly manner in the terminal.
   - Rust By Example: [Formatting](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/hello/print.html)

8. **Asynchronous Programming** (Advanced):
   - Handling asynchronous operations, useful for making non-blocking network requests.
   - Asynchronous Programming in Rust: [Async Book](https://rust-lang.github.io/async-book/)

9. **Unit Testing in Rust** (Optional):
   - Writing tests to verify your code works as expected.
   - Rust Book: [Testing](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch11-00-testing.html)

By familiarizing yourself with these concepts and referring to the provided documentation, you'll be well-equipped to tackle the project. Remember, Rust has a steep learning curve, especially concerning ownership and borrowing, so it's normal to take time to get comfortable with these concepts.
